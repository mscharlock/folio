        <h2>Who is Michelle?</h2>
        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <p>Full-stack JavaScript Developer, obsessed with communication. A pair-programming fanatic and collaborative worker, I enjoy finding functional and beautiful solutions to problems. I am looking to work for a company which shares my (REMINDER:LINK) values, where I have room to grow. I want to work on the front-end or between devs and non-devs (possibly PM, Technical Program Manager, or Dev Relations roles).</p>

        <h3>X-Ray Vision Analyst</h3>
        <p>I am developer who unites the analytic power of an English major with the process-driven mind of a programmer. A strategic thinker and planning powerhouse, I bring insight to the surface and translate dev-speak for the non-technical. I love delving into data and discovering cause/effect patterns. My work in this area speaks for itself: I brought in an additional $100,000 in one year through email segmentation to the Ronald McDonald House in Seattle.</p>

        <h3>Language Junkie</h3>
        <p>Along with being fluent in JavaScript, I also speak French, German, and Italian thanks to the many operatic voice lessons I took at McGill Unviersity while in school. I studied Italian in Florence while on study abroad for three months and German at the Freie Universitat in Berlin, Germany, while doing summer coursework through the FUBIS program. Also, my English major concentrated heavily in semiotics of the theater.</p>

        <h3>Curious Artist</h3>
        <p>In my spare time (ha!), I spend time pursuing a variety of diverse hobbies: you might find me scrapbooking, taking ukulele lessons, designing my own enamel pins, hunting for antiques, and/or writing plays on any given weekend. My life before tech included performing my own one-woman show in NYC at La Mama Theater, making sure everybody got into the dragon costume safely as part of an internship in stage management at Seattle Opera, and presenting a paper on the archetype of the warrior woman at a Pop Culture Association/American Culture Association conference. Insatiably curious, I am probably raiding your local library right this minute.</p>
